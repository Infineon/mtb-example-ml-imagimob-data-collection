 * \addtogroup group_data_streaming Data Streaming Library
 * \{
 * This library provides a convenient way to stream data asynchronously between the micro controller
 * and a host machine. It defines APIs that can be used, but does not make any assumptions about the
 * protocol that is chosen. This allows the interface to be used by a wide range of middleware
 * libraries while still leaving the communication interface up to the end application. Some
 * communication interfaces are already supported. Others are expected to be added in a future
 * release, or can be supported by the application itself.
 *
 * Available:
 *     BLE
 *     I2C
 *     SPI
 *     TCP
 *     UART
 *     USB: Communication Device Class (emusb-device)
 *
 * \section section_data_streaming_getting_started Getting Started
 * This section provides steps for getting started with this library by providing examples
 * using the TCP, UART and USB interfaces. Note that this section assumes that the required
 * libraries are already included in the application and that a compatible host is present. For more
 * information on how to include libraries in the application please refer to the
 * [ModusToolboxâ„¢ User Guide]
 * (https://www.cypress.com/products/modustoolbox-software-environment)
 * \note Error checking has been omitted from snippets below for readability.
 *
 * -# Include the data-streaming library header in the application.
 *    \snippet data_streaming_example.c snippet_mtb_data_streaming_include
 *
 * -# Select the streaming interface. The following snippets show how TCP, UART or USB can be
 * initialized for use as the streaming interface. Other interfaces are provided by the library,
 * or can be defined by the application as needed.
 *      - Example implementation using TCP.
 *        \snippet data_streaming_example.c snippet_mtb_data_streaming_usb
 *      - Example implementation using UART.
 *        \snippet data_streaming_example.c snippet_mtb_data_streaming_uart
 *      - Example implementation using USB.
 *        \snippet data_streaming_example.c snippet_mtb_data_streaming_usb

 * -# The library can now be used to perform streaming operations.
 *      - Send operation.
